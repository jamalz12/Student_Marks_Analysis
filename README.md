# Student_Marks_Analysis
Project Title: Student Score Analysis using Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

This project analyzes student academic performance using a dataset of over 30,000 records covering demographics, family background, study habits, and scores in math, reading, and writing. The goal was to identify factors influencing performance through Python-based data processing and visualization.

Key dataset features included gender, ethnic group, parental education, lunch type, test preparation completion, parental marital status, weekly study hours, and transport means.

Data cleaning involved removing unnecessary columns, handling missing values, and summarizing data with Pandas.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) revealed:

Female students slightly outnumber males.

Higher parental education strongly correlates with better scores.

Parental marital status had little impact on performance.

Scores clustered around 65â€“70 with no extreme outliers.

Ethnic group distribution was shown with pie charts and count plots.

Visualizations like countplots, heatmaps, and boxplots helped interpret results clearly.

The analysis demonstrated the importance of parental education on student success and provided insights useful for educators and policymakers. The project enhanced skills in data cleaning, EDA, and using Python libraries for real-world data analysis.
